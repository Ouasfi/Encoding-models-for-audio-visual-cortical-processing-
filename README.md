# Encoding-models-for-audio-visual-cortical-processing-
The study carried out in this project established, based on the analysis of two different approaches to the study of visual and auditory perception functions, the possibility of encoding brain activity for audio-visual stimuli by an integrated approach using functional MRI data. The essential idea of this approach is to break down a complex stimulus into simpler stimuli and use for each of these stimuli an optimized neural network capable of providing an adequate representation.
